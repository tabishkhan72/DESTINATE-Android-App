We aim to create an all-in-one travel app that provides users:
1. With interactive trip planner alongside maps and video guides
2. Booking facilities including price comparisons
3. The ability to share their journey memories with other travellers 
The app is focused towards casual vacationers and frequent travellers. The app caters to people exploring new places all the way up to families going on their annual trips, the app will be capable enough to serve all the people from different walks of life, as long as they have a destination in mind.
